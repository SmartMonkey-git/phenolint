/// Validates that excluded phenotypic terms don't have redundant excluded descendants.
///
/// This rule implements the linting check `PF008`, which identifies cases where both an
/// ancestor term and its descendant terms are marked as excluded in a phenopacket. When
/// a general phenotype is excluded, all of its more specific descendants are implicitly
/// excluded as well, making their explicit exclusion redundant.
///
/// # Rule Logic
///
/// For each excluded phenotypic term in the phenopacket:
/// 1. Determines if the term is a "progenitor" (has no excluded ancestors itself)
/// 2. Finds all descendant terms that are also explicitly excluded
/// 3. Reports a `ExcludedDescendents` violation if redundant descendants are found
///
/// # Example
///
/// If "Abnormal heart morphology" (HP:0001627) is excluded, then excluding its
/// descendant "Ventricular septal defect" (HP:0001629) would be flagged as redundant,
/// since the more general exclusion already covers all specific heart defects.
