/// Validates that phenotypic features are descendants of the Phenotypic abnormality term.
///
/// This rule implements the linting check `PF001`, which ensures that all terms used
/// as phenotypic features belong to the phenotypic abnormality branch of the HPO.
/// According to the phenopacket specification, phenotypic features must be descendants
/// of "Phenotypic abnormality" (HP:0000118).
///
/// # Rule Logic
///
/// For each phenotypic feature in the phenopacket:
/// 1. Checks if the feature has an ontology class specified
/// 2. Verifies that the term is a descendant of HP:0000118 (Phenotypic abnormality)
/// 3. Reports a `NonPhenotypicFeature` violation if an invalid term is used
///
/// # Example
///
/// Using "Clinical modifier" (HP:0012823) or "Onset" (HP:0003674) as a phenotypic
/// feature would be flagged as invalid because these terms are not descendants of
/// HP:0000118. Valid phenotypic features include terms like "Seizure" (HP:0001250)
/// or "Intellectual disability" (HP:0001249), which are part of the phenotypic
/// abnormality hierarchy.
