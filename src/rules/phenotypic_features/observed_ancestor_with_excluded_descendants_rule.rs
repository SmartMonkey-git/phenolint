#[derive(Debug)]
/// Validates that excluded phenotypic terms don't contradict observed ancestor terms.
///
/// This rule implements the linting check `PF009`, which identifies cases where a
/// phenotypic term is marked as observed, but more specific descendant terms are
/// marked as excluded. This represents a logical inconsistency: if a general phenotype
/// is present, its specific variants cannot be simultaneously excluded.
///
/// # Rule Logic
///
/// For each observed phenotypic term in the phenopacket:
/// 1. Determines if the term is a "progenitor" (has no excluded descendants)
/// 2. Finds all descendant terms that are explicitly excluded
/// 3. Reports an `ExcludedDescendents` violation if contradictory descendants are found
///
/// # Example
///
/// If "Abnormal heart morphology" (HP:0001627) is marked as observed (present), then
/// marking its descendant "Ventricular septal defect" (HP:0001629) as excluded would
/// be flagged as contradictory. The presence of the general heart abnormality implies
/// that specific heart defects cannot be categorically ruled out.
